# GAgent

## Introduction

GAgent is the foundational abstraction in the Aevatar Framework, enabling developers to build distributed, event-driven, and stateful applications with ease. Built atop Microsoft Orleans' Virtual Actor Model, GAgent extends the actor paradigm with event sourcing, hierarchical relationships, and robust state management. This document provides a deep dive into the GAgent system, especially the `GAgentBase` class, to help you understand how it empowers your business logic.

## 1. GAgentBase: The Heart of the Framework

### What is GAgentBase?

`GAgentBase` is an abstract class that extends Orleans' `JournaledGrain`, providing a rich set of features for building distributed agents (actors) that:

- Maintain event-sourced state
- Communicate via events
- Organize in parent-child hierarchies
- Support dynamic configuration and lifecycle management

GAgentBase is implemented as a set of partial classes, each responsible for a specific aspect of agent behavior (e.g., event publishing, subscription, state transitions, observer management).

## 2. Core Capabilities of GAgentBase

### 2.1 Event Sourcing and State Management

- **Event Sourcing:**  
  Every state change in a GAgent is triggered by an event. Events are persisted, allowing the agent's state to be rebuilt by replaying its event log. This ensures strong consistency and auditability.

- **StateBase:**  
  Each GAgent has a strongly-typed state object (inheriting from `StateBase`), which tracks both business data and hierarchical relationships (parent/children).

- **TransitionState:**  
  The `TransitionState` method applies events to the state, following the event sourcing pattern. Developers override this to define how events mutate state.

- **Automatic Persistence:**  
  State and events are automatically persisted using Orleans' storage providers, ensuring durability and recoverability.

---

### 2.2 Event-Driven Communication

- **Event Publishing:**  
  GAgents can publish events to other agents or broadcast to their children. The event system is built on Orleans Streams, providing reliable, scalable event delivery.

- **Event Handling:**  
  Methods decorated with `[EventHandler]` are automatically discovered and invoked when relevant events are received. This enables clean, modular business logic.

- **Event Propagation:**  
  Events can flow both upward (child to parent) and downward (parent to children) in the agent hierarchy, supporting complex workflows and coordination patterns.

- **Observer Pattern:**  
  GAgentBase manages event observers, routing events to the correct handler methods using reflection and attribute-based discovery.

---

### 2.3 Hierarchical Relationships

- **Parent-Child Structure:**  
  Each GAgent can have one parent and multiple children, forming a tree-like structure. This enables delegation, aggregation, and event bubbling.

- **Registration and Subscription:**  
  - `RegisterAsync`: Add a child to the current agent.
  - `SubscribeToAsync`: Set a parent for the current agent.
  - `UnregisterAsync` / `UnsubscribeFromAsync`: Remove relationships.

- **State-Driven Relationships:**  
  Parent and child relationships are tracked in the agent's state and updated via events, ensuring consistency and traceability.

---

### 2.4 Lifecycle and Configuration

- **Activation:**  
  GAgents are activated by the Orleans runtime. The `OnActivateAsync` method initializes event streams, observers, and applies configuration.

- **Configuration:**  
  Agents can be configured at runtime using strongly-typed configuration objects (`ConfigAsync`). This allows for dynamic behavior without code changes.

- **Deactivation:**  
  The `OnDeactivateAsync` method handles cleanup, ensuring resources are released and state is safely persisted.

- **Factory Support:**  
  The `GAgentFactory` provides convenient APIs for creating, configuring, and retrieving GAgent instances by type, ID, or alias.

## 3. Anatomy of GAgentBase: Partial Class Responsibilities

GAgentBase is split into several partial classes, each encapsulating a specific concern:

- **GAgentBase.cs**: Core logic, state management, and lifecycle hooks.
- **GAgentBase.Publish.cs**: Event publishing and downward event propagation.
- **GAgentBase.Subscribe.cs**: Event subscription and upward event propagation.
- **GAgentBase.Observers.cs**: Observer management and event handler discovery.

This modular design allows for clean separation of concerns and easier extension.

## 4. Developer Experience: Building with GAgent

> **Note:** Logging is built-in—see the [Logger Injection](#logger-injection-built-in-logging-for-your-agents) section below for details.

### 4.1 Creating a Custom GAgent

To implement your own agent:

1. **Define State and Events:**
   ```csharp
   public class MyAgentState : StateBase { ... }
   public class MyEvent : StateLogEventBase<MyEvent> { ... }
   ```

2. **Implement the Agent:**
   ```csharp
   [GAgent]
   public class MyAgent : GAgentBase<MyAgentState, MyEvent>
   {
       public override Task<string> GetDescriptionAsync() => Task.FromResult("My custom agent.");

       [EventHandler]
       public Task HandleMyEventAsync(MyEvent evt) { ... }

       protected override void GAgentTransitionState(MyAgentState state, StateLogEventBase<MyEvent> evt) { ... }
   }
   ```

3. **Register and Use:**
   - Use `GAgentFactory` or Orleans' grain factory to create and interact with your agent.
   - Register parent/child relationships and publish/subscribe to events as needed.

### 4.2 Hierarchical Event Flows

- **Upward Propagation:**  
  Use `SendEventUpwardsAsync` to bubble events to parent agents.

- **Downward Propagation:**  
  Use `SendEventDownwardsAsync` to broadcast events to children.

### 4.3 State Management

- **RaiseEvent:**  
  Use `RaiseEvent<T>` to trigger state changes via events.

- **TransitionState:**  
  Override `TransitionState` to define how events mutate state.

- **HandleStateChangedAsync:**  
  Override to react to state changes (e.g., trigger side effects or notifications).

## Logger Injection: Built-in Logging for Your Agents

Aevatar automatically injects a logger into every GAgent via the `Logger` property inherited from `GAgentBase`. This is handled by the framework's internal `AevatarGrainActivator`, so you do **not** need to manually inject or configure a logger in your custom agent classes.

**Usage Example:**
```csharp
public class MyAgent : GAgentBase<MyAgentState, MyEvent>
{
    public async Task DoSomethingAsync()
    {
        Logger.LogInformation("This is a log message from MyAgent.");
    }
}
```

You can use `Logger` for all your logging needs (info, warning, error, etc.) without any extra setup.

## 5. Advanced Features

- **Batch Operations:**  
  `IExtGAgent` interface provides batch registration and event publishing for performance.

- **Long-Running Tasks:**  
  GAgents can manage and track long-running operations, integrating with external systems or workflows.

- **Plugin System:**  
  Extend GAgent capabilities via plugins for custom behaviors, integrations, or domain-specific logic.

- **Permission Management:**  
  Built-in support for access control and permission checks at the agent level.

## 6. Orleans Integration: Why It Matters

- **Virtual Actor Model:**  
  No manual lifecycle management—actors are activated and deactivated automatically.

- **Scalability:**  
  Effortlessly scale to millions of agents across distributed cloud infrastructure.

- **Fault Tolerance:**  
  Automatic state persistence and recovery ensure resilience.

- **Stream Processing:**  
  Native support for pub/sub and event-driven workflows.

- **Storage Providers:**  
  Pluggable storage for events and state, supporting cloud and on-premises deployments.
